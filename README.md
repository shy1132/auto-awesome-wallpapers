# auto-awesome-wallpapers
very useful...

u need bun installed to build, but it can run in terminal with node or bun
im quite aware that the built installer executable is needlessly huge, im just too lazy to fix it because this is joke software

auto-awesome-wallpapers supports **windows** and **linux**, and it supports the **kde**, **gnome**, **cinnamon**, and **xfce** desktop environments for linux

enjoy...
